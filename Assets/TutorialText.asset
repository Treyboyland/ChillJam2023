  - Okay newbie, Cow Retrieval Universal needs you to do one of those on-site thingies
    because our cow observational unit (C.O.U.) is dorked.
  - 'We''ll send you in but you''re on your own to find it. You know the drill. WSAD
    to move and left click to flip ''em. '
  - The last guy wasn't very sneaky and ended up putting all the earthlings on edge,
    so do your best to avoid them.
  - 'They''re a crazy bunch, I hear some of them have even started strapping bombs
    to their cows. What nards! '
  - Anyways, don't muck it up out there. We'll pull you out if you raise too much
    suspicion.
